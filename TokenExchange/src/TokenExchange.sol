/*Build two ERC20 contracts: RareCoin and SkillsCoin (you can change the name if you like).
Anyone can mint SkillsCoin, but the only way to obtain RareCoin is to send SkillsCoin to the RareCoin contract.
Youâ€™ll need to remove the restriction that only the owner can mint SkillsCoin.

Here is the workflow:
mint() SkillsCoin to yourself, could be anyone.
SkillsCoin.approve(address rareCoinAddress, uint256 yourBalanceOfSkillsCoin) RareCoin to take coins from you (minter).
RareCoin.trade() This will cause RareCoin to SkillsCoin.transferFrom(address you, address RareCoin, uint256 yourBalanceOfSkillsCoin)
Remember, RareCoin can known its own address with address(this)
RareCoin.balanceOf(address you) should return the amount of coin you originally minted for SkillsCoin.

Remember ERC20 tokens(aka contract) can own other ERC20 tokens. So when you call RareCoin.trade(),
it should call SkillsCoin.transferFrom and transfer your SkillsCoin to itself, I.e. address(this).
